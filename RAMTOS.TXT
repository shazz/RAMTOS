                          RAMTOS.PRG for Atari ST computers

  Purpose of this program is making possible work with 
diverse versions of TOS without changing (EP)ROM's in machine. 
1 MB of RAM is minimum requirement for use, because used TOS
is placed in RAM, and it decreases available RAM for 192-256KB.

  Program supports following TOS versions:
TOS 1.00 US, UK and German
TOS 1.04 US, UK and German
TOS 2.06 US, UK , German, Swedish  and UK 'Supertos' .


       Instructions for RAMTOS:

 Program will load first file in current DIR with extension IMG -
if it is supported TOS version image file.

 On request I made version which loads straight supported TOS image
found in current DIR. It is RAMTOS7B.PRG, and TOS image file must
have name RTOS.IMG. Of course you may run it from AUTO folder too.
In that case place RAMTOS.PRG in AUTO folder of boot disk/partition
and RTOS.IMG in ROOT folder of it. 
  Version RAMTOS7B is little changed in compare to RAMTOS7 .
With 7 there was problem by running from AUTO folder and if in
ROOT DOR of boot partition was some file with extension IMG,
what is not supported TOS image file.
Therefore 7B is made to load specific filename (RTOS.IMG).

   
 If you want uninstall it, press shift+alt+control+delete keys
simultaneous. It works not with TOS 1.00.
Of course turning off machine also 'uninstalls'.

     How to get ROM-TOS images:
There is small program supplied with emulator Pacifist named
'DUMP_ROM.PRG', with which you may record ROM-TOS to disk,
on some real Atari.  
There are also many TOS versions downloadable on the
WEB, but you should look self about it, because copyright status
is not exactly clear for me. E.g. if I have Atari with
German TOS 1.04, may I use US TOS 1.04 ?

  Note: ROM_TOS image files must have adequate length:
TOS 1.00 and 1.04: 192KB or 196608 bytes.
TOS 2.06: 256KB or 262144 bytes.



  This program is freeware, open source.
