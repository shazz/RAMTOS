   IMGRF - Image run fast

It is very easy to use: just drag & drop ST
or MSA image file into IMGRF2.PRG and it
will start running image  - TOS 2.06.
Or may associate extension(s) ST and MSA 
to program, then just start with double-
click on image file - TOS 1.04, 1.02,
1.62 and 1.06 .
There are separated versions for
TOS 2.06 ,1.04 ,1.02 and 1.62-1.06.
Should work in all language versions.
In TOS 1.02 PRG must be
in same DIR with image files
if want start with doubleclick.
Otherwise put PRG in root of A
or  rename to TTP and type in
image's path (if not in same
DIR) and filename.

IMGRF0.PRG is for TOS 1.02.
IMGRF1.PRG is for TOS 1.04.
IMGRF162.PRG is for TOS 1.62
and 1.06 .
IMGRF2.PRG is for TOS 2.06.
IMGRF216.PRG is for Mega STE
with TOS 2.06, and will run games
at 16MHz (some will not like it).
IMGRF2X.PRG is for TOS2.06
and runs combined (SS/DS)
floppy images. Beta.
