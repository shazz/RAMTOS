Description
-----------
XFERRATE is a program that measures the sustained data transfer rate
of your hard disk drive(s), using the standard low-level software
interface(s) to your hard disk driver.  This means that it measures
a combination of raw drive speed, interface speed, and disk driver
performance.  The data transfer rate is measured by performing reads
of multiple adjacent data sectors (192 kilobytes per transfer), and
is reported in kilobytes per second (kb/sec).
NOTE: 1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes for this measurement.

XFERRATE v1.2 uses the traditional bios interface (Rwabs()/Getbpb()),
as well as the newer XHDI interface (if available), and reports
transfer rates for each separately.

To detect variations across a partition, the rate is measured at both
the start and the end of the partition; if the measurements differ by
more than 10 kb/sec, a range is reported (the first number applies to
the beginning of the partition, the second to the end).  Otherwise,
an average is reported.  Rates are always rounded to the nearest
10kb/sec.

Data transfer rate is measurable on any drive from C to Z (inclusive)
that can be accessed by either the standard bios calls Getbpb()/Rwabs()
or the XHDI interface.
NOTE: older hard disk drivers such as AHDI or the ICD software do not
support the XHDI interface.



XFERRATE and CD Recorders
-------------------------
XFERRATE was written to provide additional information for users of
Anodyne Software's CD Recording package, CD Writer Suite.  Knowing the
data transfer rate of your hard drive will enable you to _estimate_
the maximum rate at which you can successfully record from a given
partition, using the following tables:

     Data transfer rate             Maximum CD recording rate
     ------------------             -------------------------
     Less than 170 kb/sec             Probably not possible
       170 - 250 kb/sec                   1X, marginal
       250 - 360 kb/sec                        1X
       360 - 450 kb/sec                   2X, marginal
       450 - 900 kb/sec                        2X
       900 - 1200 kb/sec                  4X, marginal
      1200 - 2990 kb/sec                       4X
      3000 - 4000 kb/sec                  6X, marginal
     More than 4000 kb/sec                     6X

NOTES:
1. These are guidelines only; since other factors can affect the
   success of a CD recording, the only certain way to determine the
   maximum recording rate is by use of the "Simulate" feature within
   CD Writer Suite.
2. At a given speed, more data must be transferred for audio recording
   than for data recording.  Therefore, for recording rates listed as
   marginal in the table above, data recording may be successful where
   audio recording is not.
3. When writing audio CDs, certain types of audio files require less
   processing than others (the Info button on the CD Writer Preferences
   screen will show this for your recorder).  Therefore, particularly
   on slower CPUs, these types of files may be successfully written
   where others are not.



How to use XFERRATE
------------------
Double-click on XFERRATE.TTP.  When the dialog box is displayed, just
press enter.  You will be prompted for the drive letter(s) (i.e. disk
partition(s)) to measure.  After entering the drive letter(s), the data
transfer rate test will be run in turn for each partition and the
results displayed; note that each test will take approximately ten
seconds.  When all tests are complete, XFERRATE will wait for you to
press enter before returning to the desktop.

If you are running from a command-line shell such as Gulam, you may
enter the drive letter(s) as an argument to XFERRATE; in this case,
there will be no prompt, and no pause at the end of processing.

As a convenience, you may enter an asterisk as the drive letter to
request tests of all online disks.



Sample results
--------------
The following results were obtained for selected systems.  Values are
for the Rwabs() interface only, but testing suggests that data transfer
rates via the XHDI interface are essentially the same (within normal
margins of error).

Notes:
   (1) versions 5.2.0 & 6.0.4 tested
   (2) varies by partition, i.e. distance from disk spindle
   (3) in this case, the variation in effective data transfer rates
       was due to read retries slowing down transfers in some parts
       of the disk
   (4) this is not a misprint :-)

We encourage you to send us any results that you have obtained on your
system, especially if you have attained higher transfer rates.  We'll
add them to this document and publish them on our web page if there is
sufficient interest. Please email your results to: info@anodynesoftware.com.
Be sure to include all of the information, as shown above.



Some tentative conclusions from the above results
-------------------------------------------------
1. We can estimate the typical maximum data transfer rates of the various
   interfaces, as follows:

   Interface     Max data xfer rate (kb/sec)
   ---------     ---------------------------
   ACSI                    1300
   IDE           1700 (standard Falcon) to 5200+ (Hades060)
   SCSI          1600 (Falcon) to 2600 (Hades060)

2. The ICD AdSCSI+ and Link have the same performance; the Link97 is 0-3%
   slower, possibly due to the additional overhead of managing SCSI
   arbitration.

3. Both the ICD driver and HDDRIVER are significantly (about 10%) faster
   than AHDI.
